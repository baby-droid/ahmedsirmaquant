/**
 * Picking datasets in the Data Explorer's Fields filters for a lab, then going back to it.
 *
 * A lab starts a pick with its market, its current choice and its own route. While
 * `active`, the Fields tab opens More filters on the dataset tree, which reads and writes
 * the choice here, and a Done / Cancel bar returns to that route; Done leaves the choice in
 * `result` for that lab alone to take. Kept in sessionStorage, so a reload in the middle of
 * a pick keeps it.
