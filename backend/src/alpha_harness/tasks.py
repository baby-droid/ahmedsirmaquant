"""What is running right now.

Several things in this application take minutes and run in the background: a catalog
sync is roughly 1,700 requests, a returns backfill is one request per alpha, a template
sweep waits on the platform. Each of those already reports its own progress somewhere,
which is exactly the problem — there was no single answer to "is anything happening?"

This is that answer: one registry every long job reports into, so the interface can show
a single indicator and, on hover, everything behind it.

Deliberately in-memory. A task is a thing happening *now*; if the process restarts it is
not happening any more, and a task list that survives the work it describes would be
worse than none.
