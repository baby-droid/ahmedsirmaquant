"""Which models exist, and what each one costs you.

Three limits apply at once on the AI Studio free tier, and they are not equally
important:

* **RPM** — requests per minute. Recovers in sixty seconds; briefly annoying.
* **TPM** — tokens per minute. Also recovers in sixty seconds.
* **RPD** — requests per day. **This is the one that ends your session.** It does not
  recover until midnight Pacific, and it varies by a factor of twenty-five across the
  roster: twenty a day on Gemini 3.8 Flash, five hundred on 3.5 Flash Lite.

That last point drives the whole design. Someone who picks the newest model because it
sounds best gets twenty questions and then nothing until tomorrow, with no warning. So
every model carries its daily budget where it is chosen, the Lite models are marked as
the ones to use for bulk work, and :mod:`.budget` refuses a request that would exceed a
limit rather than letting Google refuse it — because a local refusal can suggest a
different key or a cheaper model, and a ``429`` cannot.

**Nothing here is authoritative except as a starting point.** Google publishes no
endpoint for free-tier quotas, so the numbers below are transcribed from the AI Studio
rate-limit page and *will* drift; correcting one is a one-line edit here. The model
list itself is refreshed from ``client.models.list()``, and anything that turns up
unrecognised gets the most restrictive real budget until someone says otherwise.
