"""Tracking what each key has spent.

Google publishes no remaining-quota endpoint, so the only way to rotate keys sensibly is
to count locally. Three windows, tracked differently because they behave differently:

* **RPM and TPM** are sliding sixty-second windows. Kept in memory — losing them on a
  restart costs at most one minute of over-caution, and persisting a timestamp per
  request to buy that back would be a poor trade.
* **RPD** is a calendar day and *must* survive a restart, because losing it means
  believing a spent key is fresh and walking into a ``429`` on every rotation.

**The day boundary is Pacific, not UTC.** AI Studio quotas reset at midnight
America/Los_Angeles. Counting UTC days would hand back a key's daily budget seven or
eight hours early, every day — the failure would look like Google randomly rejecting a
key that this application insists is fine.

Local accounting is deliberately conservative: a request is refused here when it *would*
exceed a limit. A refusal from this module can say which key to use instead, or which
model has budget left. A ``429`` from Google says none of that.
