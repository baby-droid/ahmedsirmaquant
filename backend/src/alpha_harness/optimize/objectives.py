"""What a study is trying to maximise, and what it must not violate.

Two different things come out of a finished alpha:

**Objectives** are the numbers being optimised — Sharpe, fitness, returns, turnover.
They come from the in-sample statistics block.

**Constraints** are the submission checks. BRAIN returns them with the alpha, each with
its own ``value`` and ``limit``, and the limits differ by region and delay. That is
exactly why they are read from the response rather than written down here: a Sharpe
threshold of 1.25 is true for USA delay 1 and wrong for delay 0, and hardcoding either
would quietly mislead every study run in the other.

The encoding follows Optuna's convention — a constraint value at or below zero is
feasible, above zero is not, and the magnitude says by how much. A sampler that
understands constraints (NSGA-II, NSGA-III, TPE) will then prefer a nearly-passing alpha
over a badly-failing one instead of treating both as equally useless.
